A way to make budgeting easy. A basic idea for the community, made even better by the community.

### Next steps
This app is currently available in the Marketplace for Windows Phone 8.1.

We’re in the process of porting the app over to Windows 10 Desktop and Mobile. We’re also working towards a release on Android and iOS via Xamarin.

### Contribution
We’re looking forward to receiving a lot of AWESOME contributions. No pressure.

### Dependencies
To start you must have the Sqlite for UAP installed. All other dependencies will be restored via NuGet.

### Tools
We use Visual Studio 2015. If you use resharper please ensure to use the settings in the repository for this project.

If you don't have a Xamarin Subscription, you may apply for an open source license directly at Xamarin. [Application Formula](https://resources.xamarin.com/open-source-contributor.html)

NOTE: I assume they will only offer this to contributors of an open source project.
